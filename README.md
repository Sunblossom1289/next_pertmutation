I resolved the problem of next permutation when i came across it again , I found it challlenging because it  involves thinking , 
its not just a simple data structure you apply but you have to think what will work in detail and also about the edge cases .
I found it very exciting to solve and once I achieved the solution I was happy with myself.

# next_pertmutation

Many problems can be solved by directly applying:

BFS/DFS for graphs

Sliding window for subarrays

Binary search on sorted data

But Next Permutation is a pure reasoning problem.
You have to observe the pattern in lexicographic order, identify the breakpoints, and reason about swaps and reversals and I enjoyed solving it and brainstorming I had reaching the solution .
